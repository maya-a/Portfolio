          This business sells personalized and unique gift boxes for any event, for a reasonable price. The website’s goal was to showcase the different gift boxes sold, as well as to encourage the user to contact the business through social media, for them to create a personalized gift of their own.
          <br>
          My goal was to create a colorful and inviting website for the people who stumble upon it through an add. To me, this means a simple and recognizable design that is easy to understand and to navigate through. all boxes are listed, so the user can navigate and choose one. Once he chooses a gift he can view it in more details and buy it or contact the business through phone or social media.

          Mister cocktail is a simple website to store cocktail recipes in. each cocktail has a page with its recipe and you can upload a picture of your cocktail as well, try it yourselves. If you don’t want to keep your cocktail you can delete it from the database or maybe edit it and change it up a bit. This website was made for one user and is meant to be personal and engaging. the titles are more personal than a usual website's

        <p>SockCiety, my first team project. This fun project has a special place in my heart, as it solves an important phenomenon we all have faced, losing socks! This website won’t help you prevent your next loss, but will provide a solution to deal with it. This website offers you to find your sock’s pair, and enjoy it again. On the website, you can view all existing socks and search for your specific sock based on its characteristics. If you find a sock you can view its location and the reviews other users gave to its owner. Then, you can  buy the sock and enjoy your favorite socks again.

        2. This website has been made by a team of 4. My main part was working on the Backhand (behind the design, making the logic work). This includes implementing a flight source in our code and organizing the data given from this source into something presentable for the user. My main design contribution to this project was designing the logo and creating the "About" page</p>
        <p>Joyage - final Le Wagon project. This website has a very unique goal. Helping friends from around the world meet together on a budget. The website provides different possible destinations based on the user input and gives affordable flight tickets from all origins. We were able to do this by implementing the Amadeus API (acronym meaning) in our website. This way, a group of friends from around the world can find a place to meet and book the flights in a few minutes.

    <h2 id="about">About Me</h2>
    <p class = "text-justify">Hi, my name is Maya
      <br>
      I am a 20 year old full-stack developer, currently residing in Tel-Aviv. Technology has always been a passion of mine and that is why decided to pursue it, starting with computer programming with Python during high-school. In May 2019 I took part of the Le-Wagon coding bootcamp. In the course I gained many skills, such as
      <strong>Javascript, Ruby on Rails, HTML and CSS, using API’s and many more</strong>
      , which you can view below. After the course I began working as a freelancer, developing websites in Israel and around the world.
      <br>
      Today, I am a student In the Tel-Aviv University, studying computer science, Psychology and Neuroscience. As a student I continue to improve myself and gain more knowledge, which I later implement in my work as a  developer.
